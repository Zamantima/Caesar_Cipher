# Caesar_Cipher
Description
The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a specified number to encode or decode messages. 
This Python program allows you to apply the Caesar Cipher to text messages. 
You can choose to either encode or decode a message and specify the shift value.
Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Run the Python script.
2. Choose whether you want to 'encode' or 'decode' a message.
3. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
4. Enter the shift value (an integer) for the Caesar Cipher. The shift value determines how many positions each letter in the message will be shifted.
5. The program will display the encoded or decoded message.
6. You can choose to continue by typing 'yes' to encrypt/decrypt another message, or type 'no' to exit the program.
